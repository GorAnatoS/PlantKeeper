Android Studio IDE setup
------------------------
For development, the latest version of Android Studio is required. The latest version can be
downloaded from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

Sunflower uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce Kotlin coding styles.
Here's how to configure it for use with Android Studio (instructions adapted
from the ktlint [README](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md)):

- Close Android Studio if it's open

- Download ktlint using these [installation instructions](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#installation)

- Apply ktlint settings to Android Studio using these [instructions](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#-with-intellij-idea)

- Start Android Studio
